# Lsps, Linters, and Formatters
- nvim-lspconfig controls the LSPs making sure they all work.
- Mason is a manager for LSPs, Linters, and Formatters. Easily download inside nvim.
- Mason-null-ls is to allow Mason and none-ls to work together
- None-ls is to make linters and formatters work.

# Note
Mason is useful but sometimes the package it installs is broken and its better to just
install it ourself with yarn

**Yarn install these for default configuration:**\
- pyright
- @tailwindcss/language-server
- prettier
